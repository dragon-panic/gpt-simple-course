# About
This is a simple project that was generated by chatgpt to get more of an understanding what it is capable of when generating code.

It is made to generate a course from JSON generated by chatgpt.

```
Write an e-learning style course on dog grooming. Use explanations, examples, and questions and answer sections. Only respond in JSON without any explanatory text.

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON): 
{ "title": "", "introduction": "", "content": [ { "section": "explanation", "text": "text" }, { "section": "example", "text": "text" }, { "section": "question", "question": "question value", "answers": [ { "option": "option text", "correct": "true or false" } ] } ], "conclusion": "" }
```

## Theory
Given the token limiation, the idea is to create small bits of code and drive them with declarative data generated by a gpt in separate steps.  This minimizes the amount of code the gpt model needs to keep straight.
